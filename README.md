logMonitor
========

logMonitor is a simple web application designed to identify and highlight important log messages from the typical flood of chaff.

It's designed to be quick to use and to adapt to an individual environment. The user can quickly highlight the sections of a message that flag it as more/less important and then hit the appropriate icon. The simple highlight/click workflow makes it possible to rapidly provide information to the application about what's useful.

This application is still in development phase and is intended to eventually include additional automated filters based on Levenshtein distance and uniqueness.

If you find this application useful, have any comments/criticism or would like to submit a pull request please don't hesitate to email me.
